Despite their differences, they soon become close friends. The film follows their relationships with each other and the men in their lives in the face of war. **Second** During their time on the farm, the girls learn to work hard and adjust to life in the countryside.

As they get closer to understanding the magic of the farm, they also come to understand themselves better.

Bella was targeted by seven men who sexually abused women for their own pleasure. But instead of letting them victimize her, Bella killed them all through a variety of gruesome methods.
